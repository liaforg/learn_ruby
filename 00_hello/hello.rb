def hello
  "Hello!"

# def test_says_hello_to_someone_else
#   assert_equal "Hello, Bob!", greet("Bob")
# end

# These two tests are saying there should be a method named greet
# that takes in a string, and returns that string inside of another string, a hello greeting.
# Again, the method has to be defined in hello.rb
# Try see if you can get this test to pass!
